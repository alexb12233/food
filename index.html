        <h3>Chineese foods</h3>
        <p>Chinese cuisine comprises cuisines originating from China, as well as from Chinese people from other 
            parts of the world. Because of the Chinese diaspora and the historical power of the country, 
            Chinese cuisine has profoundly influenced many other cuisines in Asia and beyond, with modifications
             made to cater to local palates. Chinese food staples such as rice, soy sauce, noodles, tea, chili 
             oil, and tofu, and utensils such as chopsticks and the wok, can now be found worldwide.</p>

        <h3>Australian foods</h3>
        <p>The lamington is often referred to as the “National Cake of Australia.” The National Trust of Queensland 
            even named the lamington one of Australia’s favorite icons. This square-shaped sponge cake is coated 
            in a layer of chocolate icing and desiccated coconut. It sometimes comes in two halves with a layer 
            of cream or jam in the middle. Found commonly throughout cafes as a perfect accompaniment to tea and 
            coffee, it’s also often baked for fundraisers.</p>
